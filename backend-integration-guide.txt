# Backend Integration Guide for Resume Management Application

## Overview
This document outlines the key areas where your Next.js frontend should connect to your Laravel backend. This is a guide for integration points rather than implementation details, as you'll be building the Laravel backend yourself.

## 1. Authentication System

### Integration Points:
- `app/layout.tsx` - For global authentication state
- Login/Registration components (to be created)

### Recommendations:
- Implement Laravel Sanctum for token-based authentication
- Create API endpoints for:
  - User registration
  - User login/logout
  - Password reset
  - Email verification
- Store authentication tokens in HTTP-only cookies or localStorage

## 2. Job Management

### Integration Points:
- `lib/job-service.ts` - Replace static data with API calls
- `app/search/page.tsx` - For job search functionality
- `app/jobs/page.tsx` - For job listings

### Recommendations:
- Create Laravel API endpoints for:
  - Fetching all jobs with pagination
  - Searching jobs with filters
  - Getting job details by ID
- Consider implementing caching for frequently accessed job data
- Use Laravel's Eloquent ORM for complex job queries

## 3. Resume Management

### Integration Points:
- `lib/cv-service.ts` - Replace mock data with API calls
- `app/upload/page.tsx` - For resume upload functionality
- `app/upload/review/page.tsx` - For resume review and editing
- `app/dashboard/resumes/page.tsx` - For resume management

### Recommendations:
- Create Laravel API endpoints for:
  - Uploading resumes (handle file storage)
  - Fetching user's resumes
  - Updating resume metadata
  - Deleting/restoring resumes
- Use Laravel's file storage system for resume files
- Implement resume parsing on the backend (consider using a third-party service)

## 4. User Actions

### Integration Points:
- `lib/user-job-actions.ts` - Replace localStorage with API calls
- Components that handle favorites, archives, etc.

### Recommendations:
- Create Laravel API endpoints for:
  - Adding/removing jobs from favorites
  - Archiving/unarchiving jobs
  - Hiding/unhiding jobs
- Store user preferences in the database
- Consider using Laravel's polymorphic relationships for flexible user actions

## 5. History Tracking

### Integration Points:
- `lib/history-service.ts` - Replace static data with API calls
- `app/dashboard/history/page.tsx` - For history display

### Recommendations:
- Create Laravel API endpoints for:
  - Fetching user activity history
  - Searching through history
- Consider using Laravel's Eloquent events to automatically track certain user actions

## 6. File Upload System

### Integration Points:
- `app/upload/page.tsx` - For handling file uploads
- Any components that deal with file management

### Recommendations:
- Create Laravel API endpoints for:
  - File upload with validation
  - File retrieval
  - File deletion
- Use Laravel's file validation and storage systems
- Consider implementing chunked uploads for large files
- Implement proper file type validation on both frontend and backend

## 7. Search Functionality

### Integration Points:
- `app/search/page.tsx` - For search interface
- `components/job/search-filters.tsx` - For search filters

### Recommendations:
- Create Laravel API endpoints for:
  - Full-text search across jobs
  - Filtered search with multiple parameters
- Consider using Laravel Scout with a search driver like Algolia or Elasticsearch for advanced search capabilities
- Implement proper indexing for search performance

## 8. Internationalization

### Integration Points:
- `lib/i18n/context.tsx` - For language management
- `lib/i18n/translations.ts` - For translations

### Recommendations:
- Store translations in the database or language files on the backend
- Create API endpoints to fetch translations based on locale
- Consider implementing a translation management system

## 9. Analytics and Reporting

### Integration Points:
- Dashboard components that display statistics
- `components/dashboard/job-distribution.tsx`
- `components/dashboard/stats-cards.tsx`

### Recommendations:
- Create Laravel API endpoints for:
  - User activity statistics
  - Job application analytics
  - Resume performance metrics
- Use Laravel's query builder for complex aggregations
- Consider implementing a caching layer for performance

## 10. Security Considerations

### General Recommendations:
- Implement proper CSRF protection
- Use Laravel's validation system for all inputs
- Implement rate limiting on API endpoints
- Ensure proper authorization checks for all actions
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Implement proper error handling and logging

## Implementation Strategy

1. Start with authentication as it's the foundation for user-specific features
2. Implement core data models (jobs, resumes, user actions)
3. Build file upload functionality
4. Implement search and filtering
5. Add user action tracking and history
6. Implement analytics and reporting
7. Add internationalization support
8. Optimize performance and security

## API Structure Suggestion

Consider organizing your Laravel API with these resource groups:

- `/api/auth` - Authentication endpoints
- `/api/jobs` - Job-related endpoints
- `/api/resumes` - Resume-related endpoints
- `/api/user/actions` - User action endpoints
- `/api/user/history` - User history endpoints
- `/api/search` - Search endpoints
- `/api/analytics` - Analytics endpoints

## Database Schema Considerations

Your Laravel backend will likely need these key tables:

- `users` - User accounts
- `jobs` - Job listings
- `resumes` - User resumes
- `user_job_actions` - User actions on jobs (favorites, etc.)
- `user_history` - User activity history
- `categories` - Job categories
- `locations` - Job locations
- `companies` - Company information

Remember to implement proper relationships between these tables using Laravel's Eloquent ORM.
